This project is a chrome extension that pulls every website a user opens, opens the domain name's wikipedia article, and then using natural language processing creates a basic description of the company or website referenced in the domain name. We then filter those results into categories like social, bussiness, sports, etc. and use the categories hit to map out a personality graph of the user based on 5 characteristic: openness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness. The results are graphed using D3.js whenever the user opens a new tab. Made at Boilermake 2015 by Peter Ivanov, Timothy Sanchirico, and Peter Woo.
